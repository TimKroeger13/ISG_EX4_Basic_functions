# ISG_EX4_Basic_functions
*TU-Berlin Homework*

###Disclamer:

All functions can be freely used.

Be aware that I can not guarantee that the functions are error-free. <br>
*Attached is also the function Expand_DecDeg.m which converts decimal seconds to hours, minutes and seconds so that all results are comparable.*

I also put the results from Task 1-3 there so you can check if its the same i have.
